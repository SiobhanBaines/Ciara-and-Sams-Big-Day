### **Design Choices**

<a></a>

#### Colors

The colours of the site are taken from the colour scheme the bride and groom have decided on which is mint green and peach. I have chosen to make the main colour off-white to keep the site bright and airy without being stark that would come with bright white as the main colour.

#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the initials of the bride and groom I will use a cursive font -tbd
For the titles and subtitles, I will use the font []() tbd
and for the main text I have used [](). tbd
