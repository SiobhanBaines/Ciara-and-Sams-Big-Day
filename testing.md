## Unit and Functional Testing
### Navigation
Due to the image on the landing page the navigation bar was not easily visible on many screen. ![image](images/user-story-images/pre-login-menu.PNG). I modified the `background-color` on `nav-items`, `dropdown-menu` and `show` classes making the navbar stand out much more clearly.![image](images/user-story-images/new-nav.png)


## User Story Testing
#### Bride or Groom:  
**As a user I want to register an account with administration access.**
When a user chooses to register on the site by clicking the 'bride and groom registration' link in the footer they are presented with the registration screen ![image](images/user-story-images/register.png). Once registered the user will need to log in. Behind the scenes the user is created with `is_staff` authority.
